# Alzheimer's Detect App - React Client

## Overview
This project is the client-side application for the Alzheimer's Detection App. It is built using React.js and leverages `react-scripts` to manage the build and development process. The application provides a user interface for detecting Alzheimer's through an AI-driven backend.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
